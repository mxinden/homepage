title: Self-Service Monitoring
---

Monitoring plays a crucial role in a microservice architecture. Restricting the
management and configuration of the monitoring stack to the operations team
results in workflow bottlenecks. Instead one could provide a self-service
monitoring platform, enabling each team to easily setup monitoring for their
applications and customize it to their needs. This gives each team the ability
to deeply introspect their application, benchmark new features and alert on
failures on their own.

The talk will show hands-on how to achieve the above on Kubernetes via the
Prometheus Operator leveraging the Prometheus systems and service monitoring
project. By the end of this talk, one will be ready to try self-service
monitoring in their own Kubernetes infrastructure.
