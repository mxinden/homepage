title: Peer-to-peer hole punching without centralized infrastructure
type: "posts"
---

Gave a talk on hole punching in libp2p at FOSDEM 2022.

> Peer-to-peer hole punching without centralized infrastructure
>
> How libp2p can traverse NATs and firewalls without coordination through
> central STUN and TURN servers.
>
> libp2p is a universal, cross-platform, multi-language, modular peer-to-peer
> networking library powering multiple large-scale networks, for example IPFS.
>
> In the first part of the talk we’ll present the basic building blocks of the
> library and explain how they fit together. In the second part, we’ll take a
> closer look at the recently added decentralized hole punching feature,
> allowing NAT and firewall traversal without the need for any central
> coordination servers (STUN and TURN).
