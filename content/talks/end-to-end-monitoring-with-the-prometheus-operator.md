title: End-to-end monitoring with the Prometheus Operator
---

Kubernetes is a powerful system to build and operate a modern cloud-native infrastructure. Monitoring with Prometheus ensures that Kubernetes stays healthy. Prometheus is a stateful application, so operating it in a cloud native environment can be a challenging task. The Prometheus Operator makes running highly available Prometheus clusters, and even an entire end to end monitoring pipeline, easily manageable. Max will explain the functionality of the Prometheus Operator and describe a desirable end-to-end monitoring stack, including alerts and dashboards.

The audience will learn how to setup monitoring for both the components of a Kubernetes cluster and the applications running inside. The talk will explain how end-to-end monitoring in Kubernetes clusters with Prometheus can look like and how to easily achieve it with the Prometheus Operator.
