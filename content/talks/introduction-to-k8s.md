title: Intro to Kubernetes
---

Distributing and deploying software inside (Docker-) containers for security,
isolation and ease of use is the new big thing. But once you got all your
services nicely wrapped - who takes care of all these containers?

The open source project Kubernetes, originating from Google, helps you manage
containerized applications, as the operating system of your datacenter, treating
hundreds of machines as a single resource pool. This talk introduces the core
concepts of Kubernetes, its benefits and its huge ecosystem and gives you an
idea of how Google controls parts of their gigantic infrastructure.
