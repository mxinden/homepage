I am Max, a [_strange loop_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop) interested in networking, distributed systems and type theory. Welcome to my little island on this astounding thing called _The Internet_.

You might enjoy browsing through [my list of resources I consider worth sharing](/readings), get some inspiration from the [numerous summaries of past reading group sessions](/post) that I organize or simply scroll through [my resume](/resume) to see what I am up to lately.

You can best reach me via e-mail: mail@max-inden.de.
