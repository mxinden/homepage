# Hi there,

I am Max, a software developer interested in distributed systems, type theory
and consensus. Welcome to my little island on this crazy thing called _The
Internet_.

You might enjoy browsing through [my list of resources I consider worth
sharing](/misc), get some inspiration from the [numerous summaries of past
reading group sessions](/blog) that I organize or simply scroll through [my
resume](/resume) to see what I am up to lately.

You can best reach me via e-mail: mail@max-inden.de.
