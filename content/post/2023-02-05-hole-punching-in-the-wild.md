title: Talk "Hole punching in the wild" @FOSDEM
tags: [tech, talk, libp2p]

Dennis and I presented _Hole punching in the wild_, _learnings from running libp2p hole punching in production, measured from vantage points across the globe_ in the network devroom at FOSDEM 2023.


> At FOSDEM 2022 I presented libp2p's hole punching mechanism, overcoming NATs and firewalls with no dependencies on central infrastructure. One year has passed since. We rolled it out to live networks. We launched a large measurement campaign with many volunteers deploying vantage points in their home network, punching holes across the globe.
>
> In this talk I will give an overview of the largest hack of the internet (aka. hole punching), dive into learnings running it on IPFS (~50_000 nodes) and finally present the data collected through our measurement campaign.
>
> If you always wondered how hole punching works, how much more successful UDP is over TCP, whether IPv4 or v6 makes a difference, which ISP is most friendly to p2p and how to overcome symetric NATs, join for the talk!
