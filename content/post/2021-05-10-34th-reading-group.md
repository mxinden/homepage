34th session was on Mixnets as lots of people suggested in the past. As a
preparation we read the Loopix paper.

Piotrowska, Ania M., et al. "The loopix anonymity system." 26th {USENIX}
Security Symposium ({USENIX} Security 17). 2017.

The corresponding talk by Ania Piotrowska is very much worth watching as an
additional resource.
