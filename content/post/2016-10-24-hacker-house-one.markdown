title: Hacker House One
---

My first day at the first Hacker House in Palo Alto. House cleaning
is every Tuesday. I arrived on Monday. The people here are amazing.
Many startup founders - smart people all over the place. The
location, _635 Webster St., Palo Alto_, is awesome, right in the
center.  This makes up for sleeping in a room with six other guys,
living in an apartment with 21 guys with two bathrooms.
