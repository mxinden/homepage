Signed up for audience seats at the sitcom [Last Man
Standing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Man_Standing_(U.S._TV_series)). We
had to arrive at 3 for the show to start at 6. They hired a comedian just to
cheer up the audience - a little strange. It is very interesting to see how
small the entire set actually is. Most of the times the actors only need 2
tries for one scene - extremly professional.
