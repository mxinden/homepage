title: Finding the Perfect Coworking Space
---

As we are working from San Francisco for the rest of the month, we were looking
for a coworking space. Well, ... not just one coworking space, but the
coworking space. We started our search on Wednesday with the [coworking
space](href="http://www.parisoma.com/"), Thursday we looked at
[NextSpace](http://nextspace.us/), Wework and
[Bespoke](http://www.bespokesf.co/) In the evening we decided to go with
Bespoken until we passed by two more coworking spaces
([Covo](http://www.hellocovo.com/) and [Impact Hub](http://www.hellocovo.com/))
on our way to a restaurant. Friday we visited the last two coworking spaces and
finally settled on [Covo](http://www.hellocovo.com/) as the perfect space for
us.
