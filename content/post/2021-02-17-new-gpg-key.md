title: New GPG Key

---

I have created a new GPG key replacing my old GPG key. I did not loose access to
the old one, nor was it, as far as I am able to tell, ever compromised. As I did
with the old key, I will use the new key both for signing my open source work as
well as securing my e-mail communication.

You can find both the
[old](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x4110045ee7a432d67afac8c85403c5464810bc26&fingerprint=on&op=index)
and the
[new](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x080694E5D36410B9C9B62185779B0E427AFE5ABB&fingerprint=on&op=index)
key on all major key servers. Along with the new key [you find a signature of
the old key signing the new
key](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x080694E5D36410B9C9B62185779B0E427AFE5ABB&fingerprint=on&op=index).

Goodbye to all those diligently collected signatures.
