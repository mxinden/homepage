title: Golden Gate Bridge

I woke up reasonably early on Saturday to go to the Golden Gaten Bridge. The bus ride from Ingleside took me an hour. I started my hike in the [Presidio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidio_of_San_Francisco) park along the west coast. I found some lonely beaches. I felt nothing like being in a city. Afterwards I walked over the Golden Gate Bridge where two friends of mine, Simon and Marc, picked me up. We drove to [Muir Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muir_Beach,_California), [Stinson Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinson_Beach,_California), [Tiboron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiburon,_California) and [Sausalito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausalito,_California).
