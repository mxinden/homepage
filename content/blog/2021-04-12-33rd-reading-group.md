In our third BGP session we focused on BGP security, more specifically we
discussed how to perform hijack and interception attacks using BGP. The primary
paper of the session was:

[Birge-Lee, Henry, et al. "Sico: Surgical interception attacks by manipulating
bgp communities." Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and
Communications Security. 2019.](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/sico19.pdf)
