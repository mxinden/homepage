title: Halloween Party or Art Event in San Francisco
---

We, my roommates and I, went to a crazy Halloween Party at[Pier
70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_70,_San_Francisco) in San Francisco, an
old industrial complex. The costumes of the other guests were amazing. They
seemed to be inspired by the [Burning
Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Man) festival.
