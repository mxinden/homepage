---

With two friends of mine I wen to
[*Berkeley*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California). We started
with downtown *Berkeley* and then made our way up to the [university
campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley). We
hiked all the way up to [*Lawrence Hall of
Science*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Hall_of_Science) from where we
had an amazing view over the entire bay.
