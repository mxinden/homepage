We started of at the[Balboa
Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balboa_Park_(San_Diego))</a>, walked down
to [Little Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Italy,_San_Diego),
visited the [USS Midway aircraft carrier museum
ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Midway_Museum) and walked back to the
car through down town. This was my first time on an aircraft carrier, these
things are huge.
