In our previous session we looked into Mixnets, more specifically Loopix. With
this session we stayed in the space, talking about a network adopting many
concepts from Loopix, namely Nym.

As a preparation, we read section 1 through 4  of the Nym whitepaper.

1. Introduction
2. Network-level surveillance
3. The Nym Network Design
4. Mixnet for Network-Level Privacy

Diaz, Claudia, Harry Halpin, and Aggelos Kiayias. "The Nym Network." (2021).
