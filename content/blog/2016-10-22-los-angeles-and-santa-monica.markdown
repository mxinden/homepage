title: Los Angeles and Santa Monica
---

We did a very short walk through Los Angeles and I took a longer walk around
[Santa Monica](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica) and
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice,_Los_Angeles)[Venice beach]. I liked the
last two a lot.  In the next two days I am heading back to the San Francisco
bay area.
